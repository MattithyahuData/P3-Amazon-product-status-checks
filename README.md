## Resources Used
**Python 3.8, Windows Task Scheduler, Gmail, Amazon** 

[**Anaconda Packages:**](requirements.txt) **smtplib, requests, beautifulsoup4**

## SMPT library to set up email notifications
Using smtplib I created a function for each email response that would be called upon based on the product availability.  
*   Created a dummy email to perform this checking. 
*   av_email() would be called if product is available. 
*   notav_email() would be called if the product is unavailable.

## Web scraping product availability data
Using beautifulsoup4 I parsed the HTML to find where id was equal to "availability" as this contained the availability data.  
*   Conducted research to see possibilities in availability.
*   Created condition for calling av_email() or notav_email() functions based on data scraped.

## Windows Task Scheduler
To automate the code running process I used task scheduler to run the code at different intervals.  
*   Batch file created with command to run code.
*   Time conditions set in task scheduler of when to run code. 

## Conclusion
* The [batch file](Product checks.bat) ran successfully for 3 days before throwing an error because of a change in the HTML indicating the product had now become available.
### After

* The span class HTML will change slightly from when it is unavailable to when it is available, but it is safe to say when you stop recieiving emails about it being unavaialble then its probably now avaialble. 

    * Product Page HTML BEFORE -- span class="a-size-medium a-color-price">Currently unavailable."

    * Product Page HTML AFTER -- span class="a-size-medium a-color-success">In stock on November 11, 2021.
